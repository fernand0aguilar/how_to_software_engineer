# How to Design Interactions

## Life Cycles

Beginning -> indentify the needs and requirements -> (re)design -> build an interactive version -> evaluate -> final product -> beginning

* Analysis: Study and plan the current situation;
* Syntesis: Plan and execute and intervention on the current situation
* Evaluation: Verify the effect of the intervention, compare the analysed status previously with the new situation, achieved after the intervention

There's a conceptual project, an implementation process, and a lot more artefacts.
A conceptual project is one where we have the intent of projecting with ideas and presenting what is, or how is the project going to be. The conceptual project is mostly doccuments, skipping the phase of implementation. Where as in the prototype phase we are focused on building an initial version.
