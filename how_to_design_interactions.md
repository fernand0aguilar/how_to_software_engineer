# How to Design Interactions

## Life Cycles

There's a conceptual project, an implementation process, and a lot more artefacts.

A conceptual project is one where we have the intent of projecting with ideas and presenting what is, or how is the project going to be.

* Know the user
* Make a competitive analysis
* Define the usability metrics
* Make paralel designs
* Adopt a shared design (participative)
* Make coordinate interface designs as a whole 
* Apply different reference lines and heuristic analysis
* Make prototypes
* Make empirical test
* Practice interactive design
* Make an user evaluation 

The conceptual project is mostly doccuments, skipping the phase of implementation. Where as in the prototype phase we are focused on building an initial version.


The differecne between the current situation and the desired situation is the main motivation for projecting an syntesizing an **intervention**

Frequently an intervention is denominated solution. Because it answers the question that defines a problem to be solved. 

## How can I enhance this situation??

In some cases it requires only a change in the process, without changing the used systems.

When the intervention is about developing systems, we must articulate the interest of all stakeholders with 
1. gathered knowledge in the analysis of the initial situation. 
2. Knowledge about good or bad evaluated interventions
3. kKowledge about possibilities and limitations of the available technologies.
