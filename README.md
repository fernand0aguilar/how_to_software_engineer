# How To Software Engineer

### Preface: 

This repository contains a compilate of all the notes taken from different sources. 

The majority of the sources are unkown, most of them come trough my personal notes,
written during disciplines of Software Engineering in the University of Brasilia (UNB/FGA).

Software Engineering is a measurable, defined and quatifiable process for building, maintainging or evolving systems and software projects. 

The difference between a Software Engineer and a Scientist is that the first is focused on building solutions for the world. While the latter is focused on creating knowledge and making a dent in researches.
