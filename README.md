# Requirements Engineering

### Module 00 - Brainstorming
* Start with why?
* Vision - What is the system / problem we are solving?
* Which characteristics are Stronger?

### Module 01 - Conceptualization
* RichPicture - Premature Idea
* Research and knowledge gathering
* Enhancement of general rich picture

### Module 02 - Argumentation
* Support for decision making
* Help to build a documentation
* Define Focus and Priorities

### Module 03 - Elicitation
* Brainstorming
  - Create the Interview and Questionnaire questions.
  - Abstract resulting requirements from other techniques
* Interviews
  - Questions coming from Brainstorm.
  - Interviews of more "experienced" people.
  - Interview subject to modification in the course of the conversation.
  - More heartfelt answers.
* Questionnaire, Observation & Contemplation
  - Questions generated from Brainstorm.
  - Reach a larger audience.
  - More quantitative data.
  - Know anonymity better.
* MoSCoW
  - Prioritization of post-elicitation requirements.

### Module 04 - Modeling

# Design & Project
The design activity comprises the entire design and modeling effort designed to describe how the software will be implemented. 

The design includes:

* **Conceptual design:** That involves the elaboration of basic ideas and concepts that determine the fundamental elements of the software in question. Conceptual design influences user interface and software architecture.

* **The design of the user interface:** It involves the elaboration of how the user can interact to perform his tasks, the choice of interface objects, the layout of windows and screens, etc. The interface should ensure good usability of the software.

* **The software architecture design:** You must work out a macroscopic view of the software in terms of components that interact with each other.

* **Design of algorithms and data structures:** It aims to determine, independently of the adopted programming language, the algorithmic solutions, and the associated data structures.

The Design or Design phase is the final phase of the planning process and results in the architecture document.

# Implementation:
Involves the activities of coding, compilation, integration and testing. 

The coding aims to translate the design into a program, using appropriate languages and tools. 

* It should reflect the structure and behavior described in the design.
* Architectural components should be encoded independently and then integrated.
* Tests can be started during the implementation phase.
* Debugging errors occur during programming using some techniques and tools.
* It is fundamental to control and manage versions so that one has a correct control of everything that is being codified.

# Verification and Validation: 

They are intended to show that the system conforms to the specification. 
Makes sure that it meets the expectations of customers and users. 
Validation aims to ensure that the program is doing what it has defined in its specification.
The verification is to verify that the program is correct, that is to say, it does not have execution errors. 
The tests are for correction, performance, and reliability, guaranteeing the quality of the software.

***

# Maintenance: 

The maintenance part involves upgrading the software to the customer's demand (s), 
either for program failures or simply for improvements that the customer needs.
